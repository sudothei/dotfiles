# Paige's personal dotfiles
I use these to quickly setup new daily machines the way I like.  
It's really not finished, but I have it here for convenience.  
I keep a bash script here to automate the stuff I normally do on a fresh install.  
Stuff in here will change constantly though, but I keep it around.
